**GET AUTOMATED CUSTOMER SUPPORT**

Training your chatbot is simple. As you provide answers to commonly asked questions, response sets are automatically generated. Behind the scenes, our award-winning language processor learns to match questions with the relevant keywords you have provided. Whenever you want to make adjustments, you can remove unwanted content with one click.

Now, it’s time to sit back and watch your bot answer questions all by itself. Whenever you’re away, your bot will continue providing friendly customer support 24/7. Immediately switch to live support with the click of a button. The best part? Our bots are fool-proof. If your bot doesn't recognize a question, it will transfer the conversation to a live agent - seamlessly.

**PROGRAM SHORTCUTS FOR LIVE AGENTS**

Help your live agents get more done faster with chat shortcuts. When a customer asks a question, your agent can begin typing keywords to pull up relevant responses. In just a few keystrokes, they can find answer they’re looking for and reply to the customer – without having to type out the full response.

These shortcuts not only save time, but also improve the customer experience by enabling your live agents to provide quick communication that your customers will appreciate. We also offer integrations for third-party apps like Slack, HipChat and Shopify, so all your platforms are covered.

**CLOSE MORE SALES, EVEN WHEN YOU’RE AWAY**

Having 24/7 customer service means you’ll be able to close more sales. After normal business hours end, your bot can continue answering customer inquiries, making purchase recommendations and guiding them to a sale.

Every week, our bots help close thousands of sales for our customers, earning hundreds in thousands of dollars in revenues. Without adding any additional manpower—you, too will see major results.
